# China?

Since all users generally use this module, Chinese Rom developments are integrated into this module. So this module is recommended for Chinese Rom.

# For noobs

## If you want to test fingerprints without needing to reboot:
```su -c killall com.google.android.gms.unstable```

## Fingerprint file:
```/data/adb/modules/playintegrityfix/pif.json```

## Country Check Termux code:
```getprop ro.boot.hwc```

Keep the fingerprints that pass the test for yourself or send them to me for support. I have fingerprints now but need more in the future.

The only method to pass the strong test is gsf hook and a lot of knowledge. I can't help you with this.
