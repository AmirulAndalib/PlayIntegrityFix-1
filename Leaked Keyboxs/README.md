Keybox files that are not already deployed or known to be very rare will not be added.
A lot 

It makes a lot more sense to use it than to follow the clowns who give 10,000 people a single Keybox file (usually stupid custom rom developers). They'll get them banned one by one, just like with pifs. But thanks to me and a few others, these keybox files have not been banned for a long time.

## Additional Information
Google can detect a Keybox leak in just 12 hours (Search bot), and less if many people are using it.

If some stupid people hint and it starts spreading, I decide to share it here because Github repos and commits don't fall directly into search engine databases unless they are extremely popular.
But too many people using it is more dangerous than a low-starred repo.

~~Of course, if one day this fork repo becomes very popular, I will think differently (like guide approved people).~~

### Known Things:

- Google will take the risk of banning the Keybox file that many people use (too many server requests). and bans it no matter what.

Solution:

- Google will take the risk of banning the Keybox file detected by the search engine (search bot) and bans it no matter what.

Google has set up an automated system so that it will not do anything unless something that is not easy to find and will not damage the company's reputation is found. In addition, Google employees are almost not even interested in Play Imtegrity and don't care. 


*If you think Google employees care about you and walk among you, you are just dreaming children.*
