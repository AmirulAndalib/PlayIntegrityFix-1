Keybox files that are not already deployed or known to be very rare will not be added.

## Additional Information
Google can detect a Keybox leak in just 12 hours (Search bot), and less if many people are using it. These Keybox files have already been published on Github many times before me.

I wouldn't have published it if some stupid people hadn't starred or forked the repo (too many people started using it). Github repos and commits don't fall directly into search engine databases unless they are extremely popular.
But too many people using it is more dangerous than a low-star repo.
