Keybox files that are not already deployed or known to be very rare will not be added.

## Additional Information
Google can detect a Keybox leak in just 12 hours (Search bot), and less if many people are using it.

If some stupid people hint and it starts spreading, I decide to share it here because Github repos and commits don't fall directly into search engine databases unless they are extremely popular.
But too many people using it is more dangerous than a low-starred repo.

Of course, if one day this fork repo becomes very popular, I will think differently (like approved people).
